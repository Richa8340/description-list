    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stacks</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
        <dd>The MEAN stack includes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. It's used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) and server-side applications. MongoDB is the NoSQL database, Express.js is the web application framework, Angular is the front-end framework, and Node.js is the JavaScript runtime used on the server side.</dd>
        
        <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
        <dd>The MERN stack is similar to MEAN but uses React instead of Angular. The tech stack includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, often used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.</dd>
        
        <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
        <dd>The LAMP stack consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Itâ€™s a traditional stack for developing and deploying web applications. Linux is the operating system, Apache is the web server, MySQL is the relational database management system, and PHP is the server-side scripting language.</dd>
        
        <dt>LEMP Stack</dt>
        <dd>The LEMP stack is a variation of LAMP where Nginx (pronounced "Engine-X") replaces Apache. The stack includes Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP/Python. Nginx is known for its high performance and scalability.</dd>
        
        <dt>JAMstack</dt>
        <dd>JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It focuses on building fast, secure, and scalable web applications using JavaScript for dynamic functionalities, APIs for back-end processes, and static markup (HTML) for front-end content.</dd>
        
        <dt>Serverless Stack</dt>
        <dd>The Serverless stack uses serverless architectures and cloud services for building and deploying applications. It includes technologies like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, where developers build applications without managing servers, relying on cloud providers to handle scaling and infrastructure.</dd>
        
        <dt>Dotnet Stack</dt>
        <dd>The Dotnet stack includes .NET technologies for building web applications. It includes ASP.NET for the server-side framework, C# for the programming language, and often uses Microsoft SQL Server for the database. It's commonly used for enterprise-level applications.</dd>
